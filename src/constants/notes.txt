Balance Beam:
'basically the same thing if you can image your stream of impulsive thoughts
        attempting to knock you off the balance beam of thinking about your breath'

Set and setting:


More Complicate:
"Increasing the complexity of the task will make it easier to maintain focus or re-focus.
      This is the value of more complex meditation formats like guided meditation.
      This is also why some people use simply physical tasks such as gardening, laundry, or dishes as a meditative format.
      As long as you are working to maintain your focus on only the immediate task in front of you, it\'s a practice of mindfulness."


Brain Functions:
The change I noticed most quickly was my ability to recognize impulsive and subconscious thoughts when they creep in.
I could separate those thoughts from my conscious mind and prevent them from taking over the ship.
This is because I practiced recognizing and reacting against these constant little thoughts.

Second, it gave me the practice of continuous self forgiveness. I know how that sounds.
I personally do not like being bad at things, and can be overly hard on myself when I don't live up to my own or others expectations.
Mindful meditation is a great exercise for this because:
1. you're totally alone
2. you're going to 'fail' dozens of times each minute
3. you inherently have to move past any failure anxiety because you are actively moving away from all thoughts besides the present task.
